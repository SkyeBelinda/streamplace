### Vertex

Verticies are the fundamental building block of Stream Kitchen. A vertex represents a single live 
video stream. You're streaming some video from OBS? That's a vertex with one output. You're 
combining four video streams, so that it looks like you're playing Mario Kart? That's a vertex 
with four inputs and one output. 

### Arc

Arcs connect verticies to each other.

### Broadcasts

A broadcast contains verticies. It's managed by one or more people.
